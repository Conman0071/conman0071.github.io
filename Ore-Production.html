<div class="introduction">
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>Mekanism allows you to refine ore and get more than one ingot per ore. There are 4 stages to the production, each
<br>stage allows you to gain one extra ingot from one ore. Each stage uses the machines from the previous stage and
<br>add on another or multiple machines. This is extremely useful for the Mekanism mod as well as other mods that
<br>require an abundance of ores. Some ores from other mods are not supported in the later stages of production due
<br>to some of the machines not accepting modded ores however all of the base game ores are able to be processed
<br>and stage 2 works for most modded ores.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stage1-text">
<h3>Stage 1:</h3>
<p>Stage 1 is the most basic stage and will only provide you with one ingot per ore. The only benefit you will gain
<br>from using this method over a vanilla furnace is that the production is faster. This stage simply uses an energised
<br>smelter to smelt ore into one ingot. The Energised smelter requires an energy source to power it. This is the same
<br>for all of the machines in this process.
</div>
<div class="stage2-text">
<h3>Stage 2:</h3>
<p>Stage 2 is a little more complicated but is still very simple, This stage will give you two ingots from one ore. This
<br>is similar to many other mods that implement ore processing. For this stage you will need the energised smelter yet 
<br>again as well as an enrichment chamber which will turn one ore into two dust as long as the ore you are processing is
<br>supported by the mod. All of the ores that have a dustr form from other mods should also be compatible in this stage.
</div>
<div class="stage3-text">
<h3>Stage 3:</h3>
<p>Stage 3 is where it really starts to implement other aspects of the mod, you will need the other two machines from
<br>stage two as well as three new machines, the electrolytic seperator, the purification chamber and the crusher. lots
<br>of mods have a crusher so make sure you are crafting the Mekanism one if you are using a modpack. First, you
<br>need to pump water into the electrolytic seperator, this machine seperates the water into oxygen and hydrogen.
<br>For this stage we need the oxygen. Pump the oxygen out of the seperator into the purification chamber, this will
<br>turn the ore into 3 clumps, then the crusher will crush the three clumps into 3 dirty dust. The enrichment chamber
<br>will turn the dirty dust into regular dust which can be smelted in the energised smelter. This stage is where most
<br>ores will not be able to be processed as the clumps and dirty dust are a mekanism specific item.
<br>
</div>
<div class="stage4-text">
<h3>Stage 4:</h3>
<h4>Salination Tower:</h4>
<p>Stage 4 will require a whole new structure, you will need a salination tower to make brine. The salination
<br>tower works on heat. You will need to build it in a hot biome such as a volcanic island or a desert biome.
<br>The more heat you have the faster it will produce brine. To build the tower you will create a four by four
<br>block of thermal evaporation blocks. next you will build the middle blocks, they can be from 1 to 16 high
<br>and must include at least 2 thermal evaporation valves on any level. The 2x2 in the center must be hollow.
<br>The top layer consists of four advanced solar panels for power, one in each corner and a thermal evaporation
<br>controller somewhere in the layer and the rest made up of thermal evaporation blocks. Input water into one
<br>of the valves, this will use a large amount of water so make sure you have a good source. Brine will now be 
<br>produced, export the brine through the other valve and you have completed this stage. 

<h4>Ore Refinement:</h4>
<p>You willneed some other machines to refine the ore as well as the other machines from the previous stages. You
<br>will need another two electrolytic seperators one to put the brine into and one for water. You will also need a 
<br>chemical infuser. To start this stage, pump the chlorine made in the seperator from the brine, into one side of 
<br>the chemical infuser and pump the hydrogen made in the other seperator from the water into the other side.
<br>This will mix the two chemicals and produce hydrogen chloride. Pump the hydrogen chloride from the chemical
<br>infuser into a chemical injection chamber. This is the start point for your ore, put your ore into the injection
<br>chamber to produce ore shards. The shards then go into the purification chamber from stage 3 and are made
<br>into four clumps then the clumpsgo into the crusher to make dirty dust then into the enrichment chamber which 
<br>will make dust then the dustis smelted. This is a very complicated stage and requires good knowledge of the mod 
<br>and how it works. It isalso a very power hungry stage and will require a good power source especially with upgrades.
